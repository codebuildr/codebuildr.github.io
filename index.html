I recently had to dive into some in-depth Ubuntu system admnistration, coming from
working mostly on Redhat based systems. The first issue I ran into, was locating Ubuntu’s
version of the /etc/sysconfig/network scripts. I needed to configure networking, and
I couldn’t determine what was managing the interfaces. The server was running Ubuntu 22.04,
and although I’ve used Ubuntu 20.4 for some time, it’s mostly been on the desktop, or
with minimal server configuring. I’m documenting my journey here for future reference, I’ll
be updating this post as I progress.
